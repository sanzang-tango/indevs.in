      question: "Is this actually free?",
      answer: "Yes. Forever. No credit card, no trial period, no premium tier. We built this because we wanted it to exist, not to make money from it."

      question: "How long can I keep my subdomain?",
      answer: "Domains are valid for 1 year and can be renewed indefinitely for free. We'll send you a reminder email before it expires so you don't lose it."

      question: "Can I use this for commercial projects?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Use it for your portfolio, startup, or side project. As long as it complies with our Acceptable Use Policy, it's yours."

      question: "What if my desired name is taken?",
      answer: "Try a variation. Add your last name, a number, or get creative. First-come, first-served – that's the rule."

      question: "Can I transfer my subdomain to someone else?",
      answer: "Not yet. Right now, once you claim it, it's tied to your GitHub account. We might add transfers later if people want it."
